After commenting out using namespace std we can see that we start to get 
a couple types of plentiful errors. I have copped and pasted some of them:

Critter.cpp:6:23: error: unknown type name 'string'

Critter.cpp:15:2: error: use of undeclared identifier 'cout'; did you mean '
std::cout'?

testcritter.cpp:24:33: error: use of undeclared identifier 'endl'; did you
mean 'std::endl'?

This arises because when we are using namespace we don't need
to add std::. But when we comment out using namespace std we need to state
std:: before cin, cout, ect. This is because we need to tell the code 
to import std namespace.

Thus, by putting std:: infront of all the cin, cout, endl, string, could be
a viable alternative to using namespace std;.

Fot the second error, we get the error: 

Critter.cpp:7:2: error: use of undeclared identifier 'name'
        name = newname;

This is because we need to add the class name infront of the 
definition of a class member function. In the tutorial session the professor
did say something about friend functions, but as we have yet to get there
it is unknown to me.
